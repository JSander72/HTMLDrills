      <!-- Self-taught to Guide Learning -->
      <h4></h4>
      <p>
        As a self-taught software engineer, I have learned a lot through trial and error, and I wanted to share some of
        my
        insights with others who may be considering a similar path. Here are a few things I have learned along the way:

        Stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices. The field of software engineering is constantly
        evolving, and it is important to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. This may require dedicating
        some
        time each week to learning and staying current.

        Don't be afraid to ask for help. While self-teaching can be a rewarding experience, it is important to remember
        that you don't have to go it alone. There are programs like Covalence that are stright forward. They doont price
        gouge or sell you on a easy path to success. Hard work and time always prevails.

      <!-- We talking about practice? -->
      <h5></h5>
      <p>
        Practice, practice, practice. The best way to learn and improve your skills is to actually use them. Find
        projects
        to work on, whether they are personal projects or contributions to open source projects.

        Network and make connections. Building relationships with others in the industry can be valuable for finding job
        opportunities, learning about new technologies, and getting feedback on your work.
      </p>

      <!-- Overall -->
      <h6></h6>
      <p>
        Overall, being a self-taught software engineer requires dedication and a willingness to continuously learn and
        improve. It can be a challenging journey, but it can also be incredibly rewarding. If you are considering a
        career
        in software engineering, don't let a traditional education hold you back with hard work and determination, you
        can succeed as a self-taught engineer.

      In 480 B.C. a state of war exists between Persia, led by King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), and Greece. At the Battle
      of Thermopylae, Leonidas (Gerard Butler), king of the Greek city state of Sparta, leads his badly outnumbered
      warriors against the massive Persian army. Though certain death awaits the Spartans, their sacrifice inspires all
      of Greece to unite against their common enemy.
